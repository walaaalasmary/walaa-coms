## Abstract
King Khalid University has several committees, and this includes many members, and each one has its own tasks. Currently, committee members are communicating with each other via WhatsApp or email which leads to many issues such as difficulty assigning tasks, monitoring committee members, reporting, etc. We suggest developing a new web application for commission management system that contains:

- Creation of a new committee at the college or department level (the system can be extended to manage committees and university level)
Assigning tasks to members
Monitoring tasks
Archive all the data in the system
- Scheduling meetings and raising their minutes

###  To use this application,
*1. make dev.js file inside config folder*
*2. Type `npm install` inside the root directory  ( Download Server Dependencies )*
*3. Type "cd client" and then `npm install` inside the client directory ( Download Front-end Dependencies )*
*4. Type "cd .." then `npm run dev`*

must have node version 14.x.x
